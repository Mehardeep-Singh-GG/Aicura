Project README
Project Overview:
This project focuses on training a model for diabetic retinopathy detection using Gaussian filtered images and a dataset containing information on kidney diseases.

Files:
gaussian_filtered_images: This directory contains Gaussian filtered images used for training the diabetic retinopathy detection model.
kidney_diseases_1.csv: This CSV file contains data related to kidney diseases and is used for training the model. It's utilized in the hj.py script.
hj.py: This Python script is responsible for training the model using the kidney_diseases_1.csv dataset.
diabetic_retinopathy.py: This Python script is used for training the diabetic retinopathy detection model. It utilizes the Gaussian filtered images located in the gaussian_filtered_images directory. The original training process occurred in Google Colab files, which are listed below.
app.py: This Python file contains the Flask application code that connects the frontend to the backend of the project.
Additional Information:
The original training process for the diabetic retinopathy detection model occurred in Google Colab files, which are not included in this repository.
